# Analysis Plan

#### So far:

Preliminary cut-based signal and background yields estimate 
 - using a coarse-grained grid search on pT, msd, and tagger scores
 - 2017 lumi + data only
 - measured for two AK8 fat jets, two AK15 fat jets, and a hybrid (AK8 for bb candidate, AK15 for VV candidate)
 - background estimation from data sidebands
 - with AK8 and AK15 mass-decorrelated ParticleNet Hbb taggers + NOT mass-decorrelated AK8 ParticleNet H4q tagger


### In progress

1) HWW tagger + mass regression development (link to repos)

2) AN write-up https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/AN-21-126

3) Trigger scale factor measurements

4) Processors for skimming nano files

5) Porting the cutting and plotting from this nightmare https://github.com/rkansal47/boostedhiggs/blob/master/binder/plot_test.py into something that is readable by humans
